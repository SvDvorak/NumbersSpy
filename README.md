# NumbersSpy
A short ARG made for my brothers birthday.

Released in three parts, two each day before his birthday and the final one on the birthday.

# How to run
Easiest way is to run it using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
After installing Docker open a command line window and in the project root run *docker-compose up*. Then open your browser to localhost:3100 and figure everything out!
