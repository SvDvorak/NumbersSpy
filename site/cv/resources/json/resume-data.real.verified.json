    "summary": "<p>Born and raised Breucian in the capital of Sensa I've always had a penchant for creative and social manipulation. Over the years I focused that creativity into graphical artistry and music, leaving my social skills to the side. But under the right guidance I was able to combine my two sides into one. I excelled during my espionage training, having finally found my calling. I like being bold in my creations... and in my missions. Whatever I do I strive towards the goal of leaving a lasting impression. Preferably the one I want you to have.</p><p>A good challenge is always preferred and so I've jumped straight into the toughest of assignments. And the future looks bright with lots of new information to gather and tasks to solve.</p>",
