    "summary": "<p>Born and raised Avengaali in the small town of Hawking I've always had a penchant for the creative. Over the years I focused that creativity into graphical artistry and music. A long time was spent honing those skills. And I like being bold in my creations, pushing the envelope and trying new things. Whatever you make it should have the goal of leaving a lasting impression, even if it is just a small ad on the bottom of the page.</p><p>I like a good challenge and try to not get too comfortable in my work so over the years I've had a wide array of different contracts. Music may have been where I started but even if music may not be my main focus during work I still try to keep my skills refined during my free time. And the future looks bright with new hard tasks to wrestle with and solve.</p>",
